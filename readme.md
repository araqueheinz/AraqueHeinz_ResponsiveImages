# Project Name: API Responsive Images

## Project description 
Using the Unsplash API, I will create a responsive image gallery with animated transitions and effects. 

## Skills used:
- SASS
- Fetch Function
- For loops
- Arrays
- Conditionals
- DOM manipulation

## Exceeds Expectations:
To exceed expectations I need to add an animated transition. When the user clicks on the logo, 2 randomly selected images will start rotating and they will stop rotating by clicking on the logo again.
